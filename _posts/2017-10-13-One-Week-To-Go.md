There's only a week to go and things are shaping up nicely:
- The event schedule is posted but still has a few bubbles to iron out.
- Workshop registration is open and there are still a few seats left [**here**](/events/2017/workshops.html).
- If you haven't already, be sure to [**register**](http://bsidespdx2017.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2138891762). *There will be perks for those registered, even cheapskates, that walk-ins won't get!!!*
