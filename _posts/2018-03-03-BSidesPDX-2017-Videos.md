Thanks again to everyone who attended, presented, hacked, and made BSidesPDX 2017 one for the ages! As mentioned during the closing ceremony, we had a videographer this year! We are currently in the process of uploading all videos to YouTube. The BSidesPDX 2017 Playlist can be found [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqdWoaf0o9zdFw9zbAfla4_NUibvkI8Ym) and will continually be updated in the coming weeks.

We are all hard at work planning BSidesPDX for 2018 and if you want to get involved, join the BSidesPDX mailing list : [Bsides PDX Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bsidespdx).
