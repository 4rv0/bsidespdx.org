### Expectations
Volunteers (like participants) are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.html). 

### Roles and Opportunities


* Public attendees are encouraged to attend any/all BSides PDX board meetings. Minutes and information about when/where we meet virtually are shared through the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bsidespdx">BSides PDX Google Group</a>.

* Additionally, please reach out by emailing info@bsidespdx.org if you have any interest in learning or participating in volunteering for the off-season sponsorship volunteer opportunities. 

* While we do not have a social media coordinator at this time, you can reach out to us via DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a> or by emailing info@bsidespdx.org if you have any interest in creative and/or social volunteer opportunities.

* Are you talented with web stuff like managing our static webpages (BSides PDX and HACKBOAT) or Discord? We are always looking for more support to make our sites and Discord better. Please reach out via <a href="https://twitter.com/bsidespdx">Twitter</a>.
