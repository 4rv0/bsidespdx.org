If you are interested in volunteering for BSidesPDX, this page has information about the roles available, and some of the expectation around volunteering. You can sign up to volunteer [on this page](../events/2020/volunteer.html).

### Expectations
Volunteers (like participants) are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.html). 

### Roles
Given the circumstance of 2020, BSidesPDX 2020 will be a virtual conference.  As such, the volunteer roles will be necessarily different this year.  They are divided into pre-conference roles, and roles that will take place during the conference.

#### Pre-conference roles
* Provide hands on expertise, logistics, and support for an on-site speaker recording setup at ^H.  This role will need to be comfortable abiding by all current Multnomah Count/Oregon State COVID-19 guidelines.
* Provide remote tech support to speakers recording talks at home, via slack, discord, zoom, or whatever technology the speaker is most comfortable using.
* Do quality control of videos and provide feedback.

#### During conference roles
* Discord moderators.
* Speaker support.
