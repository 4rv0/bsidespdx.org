## A Hands-on Guide to CTFs for the Uninitiated
### void* vikings, Portland State University's CTF team
CTFs are beloved by industry as an entry point into the security profession. However, they can be confusing and overwhelming for people new to the game style and the security field at large. We’ll cover background on CTFs, game styles, common pitfalls for new players, best practices, and some strategies to get the most out of CTFs. Then, the audience will vote for examples to work through live with the team. We’ll do as many as time and interest permits. All you need is your computer and a willingness to learn, although a browser and a terminal will be helpful. :)

*The void* vikings are the CTF team of Portland State University, located in downtown Portland. Our mission is to promote security culture, ethics research, ongoing education, and development of safer code through playing in Capture the Flag competitions. The 2020-21 officers are Robin Su, Allison Marie Naaktgeboren, and Evan Johnson.*

## All About dumping SPI Flash
### Joe FitzPatrick
The chips that hold BIOS/UEFI on your pc are the same chips that hold firmware for all sorts of embedded systems and are found all over the place.

Regardless of where they're found or who manufactured them, they're generally pretty similar, and almost always hold something important.
I'll walk through and demonstrate the process of finding, connecting to, and dumping SPI flash chips in a number of different systems with a handful of different tools. I'll explain a few of the common gotchas you might encounter, and have time for Q&A about the trade-offs of different techniques.

### Wu-chang Feng
Python programming and web penetration testing are two important skills for security practitioners to develop.  So why not develop both at the same time?  In this walkthrough, we will do just that by showing how to solve the myriad of labs of PortSwigger's Web Security Academy (https://portswigger.net/web-security) with Python programs.

*Wu-chang is a Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University where he works on developing labs and CTFs for teaching security.*

## Never trust, Always verify  : Getting to Zero Trust with Azure Active Directory
### Swetha Rai and Corissa Koopmans
So, you have been asked to implement the Zero Trust model for your organization. What does that mean?  Where do you begin?

The traditional security approach focused on the corporate perimeter is no longer sufficient to defend against today's emerging threat patterns.

Join us for a session where you will learn ideal deployments and configurations to support your Zero Trust model using Azure Active Directory. We will cover enabling strong authentication, points of integration for device security, and user-centric policies to guarantee lease-privilege access.  

You will learn: 
- Why identity is the control plane
- How to secure your identity infrastructure
- How to implement your Zero Trust model using Conditional Access, Intune and other Microsoft products
