Sponsors contribute the funds and resources that allow us to run the entire conference with only voluntary contributions from attendees. We're especially grateful for all of them, especially the ones who return year after year sponsoring the event.

We're working on revising our sponsorship process to reflect two things:
1. We're not running a physical event this year - this dramatically changes the sponsorship perks and benefits, as well as our expenses.
2. We want to reflect that our sponsors are supporing the BSides Portland nonprofit organization, which now manages more than just the BSidesPDX Annual in-person event.

Would your company like to sponsor? For less than the admission of a single attendee to a big name conference, they could be a top-tier sponsor of BSides Portland. For more information, email <a href="mailto:sponsorship@bsidespdx.org">sponsorship@bsidespdx.org</a>.
