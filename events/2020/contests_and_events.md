## BSidesPDX CTF

The scoreboard for the CTF is located at [bsidespdxctf.party](https://bsidespdxctf.party).

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition where competitors hack on binaries, web services or and other miscellaneous challenges to uncover secret flags which earn you points. Join us at BSidesPDX and compete in a CTF that take competitors through a series of creative challenges! Unlike CTFs at other conferences ours is not meant to be intimidating and there are some challenges that any attendee should be able to solve! Come and learn some new skills or freshen up on some of the basics, which are easily forgotten. Like previous years, challenges and solutions will be open sourced after the event at [https://github.com/BSidesPDX](https://github.com/BSidesPDX)
