<a href="https://checkout.square.site/buy/WFJ3UM7APMY2BPARQRPGXCXK">Registration is open!</a> We are using Square again this year.

We're postponing the 10th in-person event and will run an online event in October 2020.

### Here are the plans we have so far:
* Single track of short talks with panel discussions
* Workshops and Walk-throughs
* Capture-The-Flag and other contests
* Breakout sessions to simulate hallway track conversations
* Happy hour discussion groups to close out the event

### You'll have your choice of how involved to be:
* The talk track will be streamed on one or more platforms for anyone to view on their own
* Interact with the speakers and others with a concurrent online chat andÂ group Q&A
* Opt-in to video conference hallway track/breakout sessions to interact even more.
* Join, or even host a small after-conference online happy hour.

### We'll still have Swag:
Our plan is to prepare badges, vendor swag, and t-shirts into a conference care package that we'll distribute before the event. Expect details early October for no-contact pickup or shipping options.

### Pay what you can:
We are a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit. We're happy to have you regardless of what you can pay. If your employer reimburses you for your conference fees, we recommend the 'Patron' tier which covers the full cost of the event.
