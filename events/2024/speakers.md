## <b>China Recon 101: Finding Nation State Infra with Almost Free Tools</b>
### Jonathan Reiter (@jonathanmreiter, @bees@infosec.exchange)
The People's Republic of China has a poorly documented web, and this talk will walk the audience through some of the more practical aspects of both government and non government networks in this geo. Our thesis is that understanding the layout of the PRC web is a crucial component for contextualizing adversary infrastructure - recent operations by area adversaries, such as VoltTyphoon, used recon infrastructure with links back to PRC-based data centers.
With some background on the various Telcos and major cloud providers, plus some history of internet exchanges and the growth of social networking and the pervasive surveillance state, we'll do a brief hunt, and together learn how to make sense of unusual characteristics encountered during reconnaissance.

Jonathan is an Engineer at Dragos, where he helped build the Neighborhood Keeper ICS telemetry system, and tends to their Synapse instance. In his past life, he managed the malware database for McAfee. In his past-past life, he was a China Studies graduate student at University of Washington, and specialized in modern political economy and Qing history.

## <b>Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data</b>
### Micah Lee (@micahflee@infosec.exchange on Mastodon. @micahflee.com on Bluesky. @micahflee on Twitter)

The world is awash with hacked and leaked datasets from governments, corporations, and extremist groups. In many cases they’re freely available online and waiting for anyone with an internet connection, a laptop, and enough curiosity to analyze them. Most journalists and researchers don’t have the technical skills to do this, so most of it never even gets looked at. You probably do though! In this talk I’ll show you have to use your hacking skills for good.

Micah Lee is an investigative journalist, computer security engineer, and an open-source software developer who is known for helping secure Edward Snowden's communications while he leaked secret NSA documents. He's the Director of Information Security at The Intercept and an advisor to the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets.

## <b>Easy Mode Deception Technology Deployments @ Scale</b>
### Sasha Levy 
Many threat detection & incident response teams struggle with the idea of when to deploy or leverage 7 deception technologies. During this talk, I’ll introduce the audience to Canary tokens as a tool that enables fast, simple, and customizable token types for a variety of environments (www, macOS, Windows, Linux/EC2, k8s AWS). I’ll discuss the benefits of deploying canary tokens as a detection strategy weighed against the challenges of environment wide deployment of a new technology within a D&R program.  Mass deployment is easier than you think!

## <b>Bastardo Grande: Hunting the biggest black market bike fence in the world</b>
### Bryan Hance (@bikeindex on Twitter)
Since 2020, I have (as BikeIndex.org) been chasing and hunting the single largest black market bike fence in modern history. 
I spoke about this in 2022, but was only able to partially share that story because prosecutors were working through the case.
Since then there have been significant developments and I am now able to divulge the whole story to BSIDES. 
I’ll speak about this investigation and the larger problem in general it points to, and the new directions it 
has taken our OSINT work re: chasing similar bad guys. The talk will be audience engaging, with live back-and-forth 
and audience ‘spot-the-OSINT-FAIL-here’ type participation as we walk through the major breakthroughs that took this 
project from ‘hey, that’s interesting’ to an investigation. There will also be a general call to action re: 
“hey, anybody can do this work, here’s how to get started in OSINT investigations” using my experience with 
this investigation as the general lens."

Bryan Hance helped co-found BikeIndex.org because he had way too many bikes stolen - and he realized chasing and recovering stolen bikes was really fun. He works in cyber security and applies OSINT methods and processes to chasing bike thieves.

## <b>Building a programming environment for privacy and iterative learning</b>
### Lateef Jackson ( @lateefjackson on Twitter, https://bsd.network/web/@lhj, https://lateefjackson.com/)
Why do cell phones ask for permission when installing an application for access to the internet, yet any software dependency can just access the internet willy-nilly? It doesn't have to be this way. You will see a working prototype that prioritizes privacy first

4 takeaways in 20 minutes:
1. Motivations for privacy first.
2. Why existing options (Capsicum, Pledge) don’t meet our needs.
3. POC: Sndl Adding capabilities (controls) to Lua packages.
4. Demo: Python socket as an example of applying package capabilities outside of Sndl.

## <b>From Patch to Shell: The Twists and Turns of Exploiting a Hardened Platform</b>
### Ron Bowes (@iagox86 on every major platform)
In July of 2024, SonicWall released an advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in their GMS platform. As security researchers, it's our job to help the community understand just how bad these vulnerabilities are (spoiler alert: they're pretty bad). We didn't realize it at the time, but this was going to be an epic journey through a labyrinthine patch: 60,000 lines of changes addressed 15 vulnerabilities of various types. Plus, aggressive filtering and a hardened platform made writing a generic exploit exceedingly difficult - how do you even stage a payload without curl or wget? But in the end, we prevailed and released a Metasploit module that chains together four-five different exploits (depending on how you count) to gain SYSTEM access to Windows or root access to the Linux appliance. This talk will be a technical deep-dive into the nuts and bolts of patch diffing, Java exploitation, bypassing obnoxious filters, and using pre-installed tools to stage a payload.

Ron Bowes is a Lead Security Researcher on the Rapid7 Emergent Threat Response team, which tracks and analyzes widespread threats that affect Rapid7 customers and the internet at large. His primary role is analyzing security vulnerabilities in enterprise software; often, that means parsing vague vendor advisories, diff'ing patches, reconstructing attacks from log files, and--most complex of all--installing and configuring enterprise software. When the internet isn't on fire, he hunts for his own bugs, specializing in reverse engineering obscure protocols and protocol parsers. When he's not at work, he runs the BSides San Francisco Capture the Flag contest, is a founder of The Long Con conference in Winnipeg, and continues his project to finish every game in his Steam library.

## <b>Following the metadata trail</b>
### Guilherme Venere (@gvenere on Twitter)
When financially motivated threat actors begin a new campaign their aim is to maximize gains while reducing the chances of being detected. That goal means they will use whatever delivery mechanism is trending at the time and will change behavior once the security industry becomes more efficient in detecting them. This rapid cycle sometimes cause them to leave important metadata in their IOCs, which can be used to identify and track these actors over time.
In this talk we will take a look at how threat actors moved away from macro-enabled documents to Windows shortcut file format (LNK) files inside Zip/ISO files, then to OneNote when MS implemented the MoTW feature for these formats. We will also look at the current delivery mechanisms and how metadata can still be used to detect and track them.

Guilherme Venere is a threat researcher with Cisco Talos since 2022. In the past 15 years he worked in the Antivirus industry analyzing and detecting almost every kind of malware that was created. Now he spend his days hunting for new malware and analyzing various threats as they emerge and continue to evolve, and trying to understand how to better detect these threats.

## <b>From Light to Router: Reversing an IoT Smart Switch</b>
### Cameron Howell 
This is the story of how I exploited a smart light switch to make it into a malicious router thanks to a hard coded encryption key. I present my journey starting as someone with minimal hardware hacking experience to being able to create open routers from light switches without the owner knowing of the new hole opened up in their network. Oftentimes, to practice hardware hacking skills, people will attempt to dump firmware from a router and find flaws. IoT devices are widespread and cheap and many blogs give information on how to exploit them; this low barrier to entry makes them a good target. In this presentation, I describe my process of information gathering and the failures I made, such as trusting labels on the PCB and soldering with the wrong equipment. By the end, I show how I completely owned the device and managed to remotely flash whatever firmware I wanted by extracting a hardcoded key and pretending to be the control server. Regardless of their hardware experience, an attendee should walk away with more understanding of the difficulties involved when starting out in hardware hacking and how to approach learning through trying to reverse engineer a smart device along with some tricks to make this easier.

## <b>Biking past vendor lock-in</b>
### Will Dillon (https://tech.lgbt/@hpux735) 
As e-bike manufacturers try to differentiate themselves they've turned to cloud- and app-based features.  While these features make great press releases, what happens when they go out of business?  Are customers left with expensive junk?
In the last year, one of the biggest e-bike makers, VanMoof, went out of business.  Not only did the industry have to reckon with the impact that had on the consumer's perception of their products, it highlights the importance of initiatives such as right to repair.
In this talk, I briefly discuss these market forces then dive right in to reverse engineering an orphaned bike.  We will:
* enumerate the components of the bike and what their functions are
* reverse engineer the main board
* reverse engineer the battery management system's binary protocol
* identify a path forward to remove the dependency of the defunct cloud platform
* Build custom wiring to rejuvenate the bike with off-the-shelf components
* Demonstrate an open source tool to eliminate the need for encumbered vendor tools
* Show how you can brute-force crack the passcodes locking a common electronic speed controller.

Will Dillon grew up across the river in Vancouver.  As a kid, Will loved electronics and computers.  At Skyview High School he started the Unix club; securing donations of surplus HPUX computers from Oregon Steel Mills.  In his tenure as club president he got himself and the teacher of the computer class in trouble with the School district.
Will graduated from The Evergreen State College in Olympia Washington, and received his Ph.D. from Oregon State University.  After which, he was in the founding cohort at Racepoint Energy, a company that developed energy management solutions to more effectively manage home energy use.  Racepoint was purchased by Savant Systems five years later.  Will is currently the CTO of Savant Systems, and works from his home in Corvallis, Oregon.
Outside of work, Will is an instrument rated private pilot, and enjoys using his plane for family trips as well as volunteering.  He's currently a command pilot for two organizations: Angel Flight West, which provides free flights for patients with special medical needs and for those with financial difficulties, and for Elevated Access, which provides free flights for folks needing prenatal care, abortion access, gender confirming care, and relocation services for displaced transgender folks.

## <b>This Chip Does Not Exist: Pre-Silicon Fuzzing</b>
### Rowan Hart (@novafacing@haunted.computer on Mastodon)
Fuzzing is a critical step in the security process, and has uncovered bugs in software throughout the stack. Mainstream support for fuzzing user-space applications is nearly mainstream, but fuzzing below Ring 0 has remained the realm of domain expert security researchers. A common, virtually unsupported use case is fuzzing software and firmware designed to interface with pre-silicon hardware. To address this use case, we present TSFFS: Target Software Fuzzer For SIMICS, an open-source snapshotting coverage-guided fuzzer built with LibAFL capable of fuzzing most software that runs in the SIMICS full-system pre-silicon simulator, along with a survey of its use cases.

This talk focuses on the evolving landscape of vector databases and their critical role in efficient data management and analysis within sensitive industries. Moreover, we delve into the escalating stakes of high-dimensional data analysis, emphasizing the imperative need for robust security practices.
Over the last few years, over half a dozen new vector databases have gained a significant level of market share, each with their own API implementation with their own quirks for how data is stored.
If only there were a vector database-agnostic way to run "SELECT * FROM *"!
In this talk, we introduce an open-source tool designed to get down to brass tacks -- if you have an endpoint hosting a vector database, how do you dump out the important stuff without worrying about the specific vector database-specific quirks of doing recon, identifying the important things, and dumping out the gooey center of the vector database.
