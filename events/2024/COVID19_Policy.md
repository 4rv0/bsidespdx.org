**BsidesPDX COVID-19 Safety Policy**

Last Modified: September 29th, 2024

While masking at our event is not mandatory this year, we encourage BSidesPDX participants to mask up while inside conference spaces for the safety and health of our community. In the event that you become sick, we ask that you please stay home. The conference will be streamed live, and we will be happy to refund your ticket.
