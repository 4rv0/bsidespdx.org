<p><b>Joe FitzPatrick - Timing Sidechannel Attacks for Hardware N00bs</b><br>
Built around an ultra low-cost kit of hardware hacking tools, this kit
comes with self-guided instructions stepping through the process of
conducting a timing side channel attack against a PIN validation system.
It is a subset of the Introductory Hardware Hacking Workshop, with the
objective to:
<ul><li>Provide a beginner-level hardware hacking project with no soldering and
minimal flashing lights.</li>
<li>Show exactly how cheap and feasible hardware attacks really are.</li>
<li>Introduce some basic tools for hardware hacking</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Kenny McElroy - Introduction to exploring embedded devices</b><br>
Have you ever cracked apart a wireless access point, cable/dsl modem,
digital scale, or some other electronic device containing a whole mess
of mysterious chips that might just add up to the computing power of a
PC Junior?  Did you wonder just what the heck to do next?  Bring your
questions and answers for this workshop covering:
<ul><li>Introduction to black box board reconnaissance.</li>
<li>Meet the BusPirate</li>
<li>Intro to UART: What it is, how to find it and how to use it.</li>
<li>Intro to I2C: Same deal.</li>
<li>As time allows, explore SPI and JTAG too!</li>
</ul></p>
