title: "BSidesPDX CFP Review Board"
---
As BSidesPDX has evolved over the years into a larger event, the process of curating the content has evolved as well. In an effort to recognize that the goal of BSidesPDX is to support the local information security community, we've recruited a set of local experts to help with the selection process.

  <p><strong> Michael Leibowitz</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/r00tkillah" target="_blank">@r00tkillah</a>) has done hard-time in real-time. An old-school computer engineer by education, he spends his days hacking the mothership for a fortune 100 company. Previously, he developed and tested embedded hardware and software, fooled around with strap-on boot roms, mobile apps, officesuites, and written some secure software. On nights and weekends he hacks on electronics, writes CFPs, and contributes to the NSA Playset. He is the chairman of our CFP this year.</p>
