## <b>Keynote</b>

### Ken Westin ([@kwestin](https://twitter.com/kwestin))

Ken Westin has been in the cybersecurity field for over 15 years working with companies to improve their security posture, through threat hunting, insider threat programs and vulnerability research. In the past he has worked closely with law enforcement helping to unveil organized crime groups. His work has been featured in Wired, Forbes, New York Times, Good Morning America and others, and is regularly reached out to as an expert in cybersecurity, cybercrime and surveillance. 

Ken is an Oregon Native who splits his time between a house in the woods near Portland and a beach shack on the Oregon Coast with his wife, son and two dogs. He holds a BA from Lewis & Clark College and a graduate degree from the University of Portsmouth UK along with several security certifications. He is a self-professed guitar and record hoarder and amatuer musician.

## <b>Reverse engineering how WAFs (fail to) identify bots</b>
### Devin Gaffney ([@intl_persuasion](https://twitter.com/intl_persuasion))
As online systems have exploded in complexity, so too have hacks that seek to manipulate platforms and websites with automated bots mimicking human behavior. In response, a six billion dollar web application firewall industry has risen to attempt to thwart malicious bots using a variety of methods. In this talk, we use a survey of 193 large retail sites, 44 distinct bot implementations, machine learning, and statistical feature extraction to identify what bot design features have the highest correlations with firewall circumvention. We find clear evidence of a hierarchy of bot features that are most indicative of circumvention - used jointly, we observe extraordinary success rates in firewall circumvention. We conclude that while these are useful tools for circumvention, to the trained practitioner they merely present a security theater defense.

## <b>Cloudy With A Chance of Purple Rain:<br>Leveraging Stratus Red Team to Secure Your Clouds</b>
### Luciano Avendano  ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianavendan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianavendan))
This presentation will guide the audience in performing purple team exercises using Stratus Red Team and VECTR. We will demonstrate the ease of use and operational value of Stratus Red Team, an open-source, AWS focused attack technique tool. We will also demonstrate how VECTR, a free tracking tool, can be used in concert to document and measure detection and prevention capabilities of red and blue (purple) teams across different attack scenarios and easily generate reports on those capabilities.
Code42’s Security Operations team leverages Purple Team methodology to perform collaborative tool, technique, and procedure (TTP) exercises. Generally, the goals of conducting a Purple Team exercise are to: test attack techniques against a target organization, improve defender’s identification skills, improve the team’s communication process, and foster a collaborative culture within security offensive and defensive teams.
This presentation will demonstrate how these free and open source tools and methodologies can advance the security posture of the organization through the creation of high-fidelity behavior detection, testing defenses and security controls, and demonstrating increased detection capabilities through continuous Purple Team exercises.

## <b>The Ace is the Place - Stealthy LDAP Domain Reconnaissance</b>
### Garrett Foster ([@garrfoster](https://twitter.com/garrfoster))
A challenge red team operators face is collecting data from a target environment while remaining evasive and undetected. LDAP is goldmine of information wanting to be plundered yet tools like BloodHound have the attention of defenders who've built detections around how rapidly and broadly the data is recovered. What if an operator could leverage the ACL data collection features of Bloodhound but in a slow, methodical, and targeted approach to evade detection. By beginning ACL information gathering at the goal and walking backwards to identify exploitation paths the operator remains evasive while collecting only the data needed to be successful.

## <b>macOS persistence, LaunchAgents and Beyond</b>
### Will Kinderman
While macOS is built on top of BSD, its persistence mechanisms can be very different. How do you ensure that you can maintain persistence to a host?
I'll demonstrate various ways persisting on macOS given different levels of permissions. We'll start with the obvious, Launch Agents, and then move into more advanced techniques such as Folder Actions. We'll discuss some pros and cons of each technique.
