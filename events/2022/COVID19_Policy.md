**BsidesPDX COVID-19 Safety Policy**

Last Modified: August 17th, 2022

Our community's health and safety are our top priority. We are closely monitoring the health and safety orders provided by the City of Portland, Multnomah County, and the State of Oregon, as well as the policies of our venue partner, Portland State University. Things can change at any time, especially with the arrival of new variants. If we change this policy in any material way, we will provide updates via this page, our email list, and social media.
At the current time, none of the above mentioned entities is requiring vaccination, negative test results, or masking at an event of our size.  
However, we have chosen to require masking at our event, in any areas dedicated to BSidesPDX activities.  This includes presentation and workshop rooms, and anywhere badges will be checked for entry.  The building we are using for the event is a shared space, so in common spaces (hallways, etc) we cannot enforce masking.  
We are requiring that all participants of BSidesPDX wear a mask while inside of conference spaces for the entirety of the event, except when you are 1) actively eating or drinking; or 2) a presenter actively giving your talk/workshop. Masks must be worn completely over both your mouth and nose.

**Failure to comply with our mask policy will result in removal from the event without refund or recourse.**

Know which masks provide the best protection against COVID-19:
- Most Effective
    - N95
- More Effective
    - KF94
    - KN95
    - Double Mask
    - Fitted Surgical Mask
- Effective
    - Surgical Mask
- Least Effective
    - Fabric mask with three or more cloth layers


No matter what kind of mask you wear, check the fit and eliminate gaps above the nose or on the sides. Gaps will significantly reduce the effectiveness of any mask.
In addition:
    - Bandana style or other single layer cloth masks are not permitted.
    - Masks with a respirator valve are not permitted.

# Not feeling well? 
Out of respect for everyoneâ€™s health, we ask that you do not attend if any of the following is true:
    - You are not feeling well.
    - You have any of the symptoms related to COVID-19, especially loss of taste or smell and/or fever.
    - You have recently been diagnosed with COVID-19.
    - You have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.

# Refund: 
If you are not able to attend due to health reasons or your inability to comply with this policy, please contact <a href="mailto:info@bsidespdx.org?subject=Requesting a refund">info@bsidespdx.org</a> to request a refund for your registration. Refunds may be granted at our discretion.
