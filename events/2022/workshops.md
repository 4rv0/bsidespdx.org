## <b>Beginner Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge Carousel</b>

### The void* Vikings 
Jumping into your first CTF can be scary! Let us show you the ropes by introducing five major CTF categories. Look forward to hands-on learning with our mentors as you rotate through stations. Each station will have an introduction, demonstration, and challenges to try for yourself! Topics covered include: OSINT, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Steganography, Web and Network Security.

<i>The void* Vikings are the Portland State University security club and CTF team!
Our mission is: Promoting security culture, ethics, research, ongoing education, and development of safer code through playing and competing in Capture The Flag competitions
The 2022-23 officers are: Allison Marie Naaktgeboren, Tristan Gomez, and Travis Noyes</i>
