Since capacity is limited, we do attach a nominal $10 fee to advance registration to prevent speculative registrations and limit no-shows. We will not keep a waitlist, but empty seats will be made available first-come-first-served at the start of the workshop.

If for any reason, this fee is a barrier to your attending, use the coupon code ‘IPROMISETOATTEND’ to register for free.

## <b>Pivoting, Tunneling, and Redirection Master Class </b>
### Barrett Darnell ([@pwneip](https://twitter.com/pwneip)), Wesley Thurner ([@nopresearcher](https://twitter.com/nopresearcher)) 
Pivoting, tunneling, and redirection are essential skills that separate the junior and senior operators in the offensive security landscape. This workshop describes various techniques used to creatively route traffic through multiple network segments. Various tools and techniques will be discussed and demonstrated. Attendees will be able to practice these skills in a provided cyber range during and after the workshop. These are essential skills for every pentester, bug bounty hunter, and red team operator. But that's not all! Defenders will learn techniques for detecting these sorts of suspicious traffic in their network.

## <b>Creating cybersecurity training exercises with EDURange </b>
### Jens Mache, Levi Overcast, Seth Leichsenring, Richard Weiss 
EDURange allows for users to host the application on their own hardware, or to be run on a central cloud server. You can spin up any of our exercises or create your own to play on-demand. Our exercises take the form of one or more docker containers with built-in challenges which range in difficulty from command line basics to more advanced network reconnaissance and Metasploit. Using Terraform, one can customize our exercises to add tools or artifacts to the existing exercises, or make more extensive changes, EDURange could be the perfect solution for you. 
In this workshop, we will show how to create hands-on cybersecurity experiences with assessments using the EDUrange platform. We will work through creating and launching EDUrange scenarios. We provide pre-configured Docker images and a framework for creating your own. You can host EDUange instances from anywhere that works best for you — AWS, Goggle cloud, Azure or on your own hardware locally.
By the end of this workshop, you will know how to set up your own CTF using EDURange. See some of the exercises at https://edurange.org/scenarios.html
