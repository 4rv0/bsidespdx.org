View last year's contests [here](https://sites.google.com/site/bsidesportland/contests).

**BSidesPDX CTF**

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition where competitors hack on binaries, web services or challenges to uncover secret flags which earn you points. Join us at BSidesPDX and compete in a CTF that take competitors through a series of web & binary exploitation, trivia, shellcoding and reverse engineering challenges! Unlike CTFs at other conferences ours is not meant to be intimidating and there are some challenges that any attendee should be able to solve! Come and learn some new skills or freshen up on some of the basics, which are easily forgotten. This year will introduce new CTF infrastructure and we are excited about it!

**Infosec Quiz Show!**

JOIN US AGAIN AT BSIDES PDX FOR THE ULTIMATE CONTEST OF SECURITY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE!

This is the game where we take some BSides attendees and pit them against each other in a battle of wits to see who's the smartest... who's the fastest... who's going to emerge with the ultimate alpha-geek status for the next year!

WHAT'S IT LIKE?
Just like many TV game shows you're probably already familiar with.  We take three contestants, put them on stage and ask them a series of questions relating to aspects of system and network security, exploits, hacking, hardware, software, administration, history, and even some random bits of pop culture thrown in for hack value.

SOUNDS COOL! WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

Game time: TBA
(Contestants please plan to arrive 20 minutes early.)

**Karmageddon**

Hey, do you like reddit?  Do you have mad karma havesting skills?  Sign up for Karmageddon at [http://karmageddon.net/](http://karmageddon.net/), and test your karma skills against other BSidesPDX attendees!

**Tech Book Swap**

Back this year is the Tech Book Swap to freshen up your bookshelf. Bring in any good-condition recent tech, computer, programming, or security book and trade it for another. This will run informally and on the honor system for the duration of the event at one of the tables in the event room.
