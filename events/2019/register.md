<a href="https://bsides-pdx.square.site/product/BsidesPDX2019/7">Registration is open!</a> This year we're trying Square for registrations. Lots of event management sites have pricing schemes that don't work well for events our size.

We are a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit. We're happy to have you regardless of what you can pay. If your employer reimburses you for your conference fees, we recommend the 'Patron' tier which covers the full cost of the event.

Once again, T-shirts are a separate item. TheyÂ will be available for pickup at the event until noon on Saturday, when remaining shirts will be given away first-come-first-served.

We will cut off free registration and t-shirt sales on October 1st.
