## OWASP Top Ten Lab Featuring OWASP Juice Shop
### David Quisenberry ([@quizsec](https://twitter.com/quizsec))
The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.  Injection, Broken Authorization, Sensitive Data Exposure are just some of the categories it covers.  This training will provide those unfamiliar with the OWASP Top Ten an opportunity to learn about the categories hands on through the OWASP Juice Shop - an intentionally insecure web application.

## Introduction to Binary Exploitation
### Aaron Esau ([@arinerron](https://twitter.com/arinerron)), Aaron Jobé ([@dirtyc0wsay](https://twitter.com/dirtyc0wsay))
Ever wondered how vulnerabilities like BlueKeep and Eternal Blue work, or are you just interested in learning about the binary exploitation Capture The Flag (CTF) category? This workshop will walk students through exploiting their first buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It will teach them how to develop their own exploits and obtain RCE by redirecting the flow of code execution to shellcode or libraries with or without ASLR enabled. Students should have some experience with Python and Linux and are expected to bring a laptop with VirtualBox and an SSH client installed (a VM will be provided).

<a name="Investigation Basics Crash Course"></a>
## Investigation Basics Crash Course
### William Peteroy and Alex Sirr
This workshop will get attendees smart on the foundations they need to perform an end-to-end investigation from network to host. We will cover triage and evidence collection for endpoint and network with a focus on key data points from each that allow us to pivot from endpoint to network data (and vice versa). 

We will discuss basic topics, open-source and commercial tools, build an investigation timeline and triage report with a hands-on lab.

Attendees should have a basic understanding of network (ports, protocols, etc) and endpoint (logs, files, windows registry, file system) fundamentals to get the most out of the workshop.

<a name="Practical Threat Modelling"></a>
## Practical Threat Modelling
### Amiran Alavidze
Threat modelling is considered to be a critical component of Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as evidenced by the fact that it’s included in most SDLC methodologies (see Microsoft SDL or OWASP Secure Software Development Lifecycle Project, for example). There’s a ton of information available on threat modelling, though most of it seems to be focused on explaining the importance of it, or where it should fit within SDLC, not so much on practical aspects of how it can be done. 

This workshop presents a practical collaborative approach to threat modelling with focus on applicability to Agile teams of various scales. We’ll spend a bit of time on threat modelling overview, but the majority of the workshop will be dedicated to going through an example threat modelling session and creating a sample threat model.

You might be interested in this workshop if you are a security engineer, software engineer, engineering manager, or product manager.

There are no prerequisites, but you are expected to actively participate.

*Amiran has been in information security for over 15 years with roles ranging from system engineering and security operations to governance, risk and compliance. Amiran is advocating practical and business-focused approach to security.

<a name="Minimalist triage of malcode using CyberChef"></a>
## Minimalist triage of malcode using CyberChef
### Mark Baenziger 
This workshop provides some helpful and lightweight tools/techniques for both new and experienced SOC analysts and incident responders to speed up their ability to understand and characterize a potential incident. It provides some context and examples about how and why these tools and techniques so consistently show up in SOC triage and analysis efforts.

There are many sophisticated and complex endpoint detection and response tools, sandboxes, and analysis tools which a SOC analyst or incident responder can use to identify and understand a potential incident. Many of these tools are complex and powerful, but sometimes it’s the simple tools combined with specific host logging configuration options which can make a difference for SOC analysts and incident responders.

This workshop came from my recent realization that the most frequently used tools I was using while looking at incidents had something to do with de-obfuscation or decoding of powershell or other encoded scripts, and I was using CyberChef to do the vast majority of it. Given the prevalence of powershell and encoding in commodity malware campaigns, exploit kits, and in post-exploitation activity, it is likely that most incident responders will benefit from sharing experiences and techniques using these tools. Often, CyberChef and some key powershell logging options are enough to allow a responder to rapidly triage an event or alert to decide whether it’s significant or not, which is why I felt there was value in sharing the techniques I was using.

In this workshop I’ll describe why these tools/techniques are important to the detection/incident triage process, provide some examples of the key configurations/logs that are needed to maximize benefit, and provide (and then walk through) several technical decoding examples for the workshop attendees. Please bring your laptop!""

<a name="Open Season: Building a Threat Hunting Program with Open Source Tools"></a>
## Open Season: Building a Threat Hunting Program with Open Source Tools
### Travis Smith & Ken Westin 
The purpose of this session is to go over the resources which are freely available to anyone to make testing their security posture simple. The main toolsets for this portion of the lab are going to be Atomic Red Team, MITRE ATT&CK Adversary Emulation Plans, APT Simulator and LOLbins.  Using these tools, we can select multiple techniques to abuse a victim machine in various ways. This is intended to be interactive and exciting for security professionals who are not exposed to the red-teaming side of security.
 
After the abuse of each technique, we can look at the telemetry gathered by the endpoint. To make this resonate with all attendees, we will be using telemetry from Microsoft and their SysInternals tools, which will then be collected and visualized using the Elastic stack. Using the Elastic stack, we can dig into the telemetry and pivot around to understand the scope of an incident.
 
Attendees will have the opportunity to see real-world use cases of “malware” in action, as these are being pulled and linked back to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This will also demonstrate the power of collecting telemetry for the use of security analytics. We are going to be using free tools in the lab, but the data collected and visualized can reproduced by a number of vendors on hand at RSA each year. Attendees will be able to take this knowledge back to their organization and increase their security posture immediately.

*Travis Smith is a Principal Security researcher with Tripwire, focused on creating defensive solutions for enterprise businesses.

<a name="Hacking USB on the Cheap with USB-Tools"></a>
## Hacking USB on the Cheap with USB-Tools
### Kate Temkin & Mikaela Szekely 
Until recently, fully exploring the world of USB has been challenging -- as tools for working with USB have historically been expensive and difficult to obtain, and knowledge regarding USB has been cloistered away in lengthy and somewhat-obtuse specifications -- but recent developments in USB tooling have made working with USB significantly more accessible.

This workshop provides an overview of USB security and USB-hacking techniques using inexpensive open-source software and hardware tools -- including several tools developed by the presenters in order to make USB hacking more accessible. The workshop includes a variety of demonstrations, and is accompanied by a set of short exercises that allow attendees to get some USB-hacking experience.

This workshop is best experienced when attendees bring a laptop with a working Python3 installation to follow along with.

*Kate Temkin leads the software development team at Great Scott Gadgets. Kate is a seasoned USB researcher, and maintains a variety of open-source hardware and software tools, including FaceDancer and GreatFET, and has discovered a number of well-known USB vulnerabilities– including CVE-2018-6242, which famously allowed full exploitation of the Nintendo Switch. When not researching hardware security herself, her passions include making hardware and reverse engineering more accessible to everyone who wants to learn.*

*Mikaela Szekely is an open-source software and hardware enthusiast with a long-standing interest in USB, embedded systems, and the (ab)use of arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities on video game consoles. At the confluence of these interests, she maintains “fusée-launcher”, an open-source USB exploit tool and firmware loader for the Nintendo Switch.
