## BSidesPDX CTF

*The scoreboard for the CTF is located at [bsidespdxctf.party](https://bsidespdxctf.party).*

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition where competitors hack on binaries, web services or challenges to uncover secret flags which earn you points. Join us at BSidesPDX and compete in a CTF that take competitors through a series of web & binary exploitation, shellcoding and reverse engineering challenges! Unlike CTFs at other conferences ours is not meant to be intimidating and there are some challenges that any attendee should be able to solve! Come and learn some new skills or freshen up on some of the basics, which are easily forgotten. Like last years, everything will be open sourced after the event at [https://github.com/BSidesPDX](https://github.com/BSidesPDX)

## BSides 2019 Quiz Show
This is the game where we take some BSides attendees and pit them against each other in a battle of wits to see whoâ€™s the smartestâ€¦ whoâ€™s the fastestâ€¦ whoâ€™s going to emerge with the ultimate alpha- geek status for the next year!

WHATâ€™S IT LIKE? Just like many TV game shows youâ€™re probably already familiar with. We take three contestants, put them on stage and ask them a series of questions relating to aspects of system and network security, exploits, hacking, hardware, software, administration, history, and even some random bits of pop culture thrown in for hack value.

SOUNDS COOL! WHERE DO I SIGN UP? Click [HERE](https://forms.gle/56kJM8sFmPtBE3H89) for the qualifier! (That link also points you to past shows if you want to see real examples of the game.)

He lives in the Portland, Oregon area and keeps a vintage Altair 8800 and COSMAC Elf as pets.

## Whose Slide Is It Anyway?
As seen at Defcon, Derbycon, Circle City Con, and others, Whose Slide Is It Anyway makes it's PNW debut at BsidesPDX. Contestants will give lightning talks between 5 and 7 minutes, with the aid of a slide deck that is randomly chosen and they have never seen before. Our panel of subject matter expert judges will award arbitrary amounts of points (and often times random things that aren't points) to contestants based on their performances. At the end of the event, scores will be tallied and the top three contestants will be awarded prizes.

## BSidesPDX Backpack Drive for Foster Youth

Everyday 1,200 kids enter the foster system in the United States. Making a bad day worse they often have only a few minutes to gather anything and everything of value to them before being shipped off to strangers. While the foster system is now aware of the trauma and stigma that comes from using trash bags, oftentimes they donâ€™t have other options.

Most people in tech have a thing for bags and backpacks. They tend to clutter our shelves, often stuffed inside each other like Russian nesting dolls. Letâ€™s do something great and try to make this awful experience for them a little bit better.

If you are able to, come and donate a bag and we will ensure it reaches the right place! Bins will be placed in the event room for easy drop off.
