## BSidesPDX CTF

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a computer security competition where competitors hack on binaries, web services or challenges to uncover secret flags which earn you points. Join us at BSidesPDX and compete in a CTF that take competitors through a series of web & binary exploitation, shellcoding and reverse engineering challenges! Unlike CTFs at other conferences ours is not meant to be intimidating and there are some challenges that any attendee should be able to solve! Come and learn some new skills or freshen up on some of the basics, which are easily forgotten. Like last years, everything will be open sourced after the event at [https://github.com/BSidesPDX](https://github.com/BSidesPDX)

The scoreboard for the CTF is located at [bsidespdxctf.party](https://bsidespdxctf.party).

## OSINT CTF for Missing Persons

BSides Portland has teamed up with Trace Labs to offer a secondary CTF for this year.

Trace Labs provides crowd sourced, open source intelligence (OSINT) to find missing persons. They achieve this by bringing together groups of information security professionals and hackers to conduct open source intelligence operations in an attempt to collect intel on real missing persons. 

This new, non-theoretical CTF allows contestants to collect flags on real missing persons. The more valuable these flags are to law enforcement, the more points teams earn. 

While this is a game designed to be fun and competitive, it also helps families with missing loved ones. The information we collect is submitted to law enforcement to help aid them in their search.

If you want to sign up please do so [here](https://www.tracelabs.org/accounts/register/) and ensure you select BSides Portland 2018 and your desired team name. If you want to learn more visit [tracelabs](https://www.tracelabs.org).

## BSides PDX Quiz Show Abstract: Infosec Quiz Show!

This is the game where we take some BSides attendees and pit them against each other in a battle of wits to see who’s the smartest... who’s the fastest... who’s going to emerge with the ultimate alpha- geek status for the next year!

WHAT’S IT LIKE? Just like many TV game shows you’re probably already familiar with. We take three contestants, put them on stage and ask them a series of questions relating to aspects of system and network security, exploits, hacking, hardware, software, administration, history, and even some random bits of pop culture thrown in for hack value.

SOUNDS COOL! WHERE DO I SIGN UP? Click [HERE](https://goo.gl/forms/2b3ZSkdvvLwebiJn2) for the qualifier! (That link also points you to past shows if you want to see real examples of the game.)
