As BSidesPDX has evolved over the years into a larger event, the process of curating the content has evolved as well. In an effort to recognize that the goal of BSidesPDX is to support the local information security community, we've recruited a set of local experts to help with the selection process.

  <p><strong> Timothy D. Morgan </strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/ecbftw" target="_blank">@ecbftw</a>) taught himself how to write software at the age of twelve and began
tinkering with security shortly thereafter.  After earning his computer science
degrees (B.S., Harvey Mudd College and M.S., Northeastern University) and
spending a short time as a developer, he began his career as a pentester and
security researcher.  Tim's work in application security spans 13 years and
includes the publication of dozens of vulnerabilities in widely used software.
He has been teaching application security throughout that time, delivering
trainings and talks at major conferences, including OWASP AppSecUSA and
BlackHat USA.  Tim currently resides in Portland, Oregon where he volunteers
for the local OWASP chapter.
